# Project Name: Leaderboard

 The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

 The project will be done in 3 pahses. 
 
 In the 1st phase the basic structure of html and javascript will be created.

 In the 2nd pahse API functionality will be added.

 In the 3rd phase the style will be added using CSS.

- Project requirements for 1st phase:

. Develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality

. Use Gitflow.

. Create an npm project with webpack.

. Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps.

. Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).

. Use ES6 modules, with import and export.

. Wireframe for 1st phase:
